**Product Functions**

● Searching functionality : This feature allows users to search for recipes based on specific keywords. When a user enters a keyword, the app sends a request to an API, which returns a list of relevant recipes. The results are displayed with pagination, cooking time, serving size, and ingredients. This makes it easier for the user to find the exact recipe they are looking for.

● Changing the quantity functionality : This feature allows users to adjust the recipe according to their desired number of servings. When the user increases or decreases the serving size, the ingredients are automatically updated to reflect the change. This helps users to avoid the hassle of manually calculating the amount of ingredients needed for their desired serving size.

● Bookmarking functionality : This feature allows users to bookmark their favorite recipes for easy access later. The app displays a list of all bookmarked recipes, making it easy for users to find and use their favorite recipes at any time.

● Create own recipe : This feature allows users to upload their own recipes to the app. Once a recipe is uploaded, it is automatically bookmarked for easy access later. Users can only see their own recipes and not the recipes from other users. This provides users with a personalized recipe collection that they can use and refer to anytime.

● Keeping the recipe stored in local storage: This feature ensures that the recipe data is stored on the user's device, allowing them to access their recipes even when they are offline. The app uses JavaScript and HTML5 local storage API to store and retrieve the recipe data as key-value pairs. This ensures that the user's recipe collection is always accessible and secure.
